# Game of Life

Welcome to the GPU implementation of Conway's Game of Life! This project explores the world of graphics programming using raylib and GLSL shaders.

## Overview:

- **Project Description:** This project implements Conway's Game of Life using GPU acceleration. The game is a cellular automaton where cells on a grid evolve over time based on a set of rules.
- **Technology Stack:**
  - **raylib:** A simple and easy-to-use library for game development in C. It provides a range of functionalities for graphics, input handling, and more.
  - **GLSL:** The OpenGL Shading Language is used for writing shaders that run on the GPU. In this project, GLSL shaders are employed to implement the rules of the Game of Life.
  
In this project, the game evolves on the GPU, offering potentially significant performance improvements compared to traditional CPU-based implementations.

Happy coding!
